- main:
    - SSL fix, use nix-shell with pinned values for an SSL cert fix
    - have the start script not use nix-shell so that nix-shell can be detected
    - change all the places that use PROJECTR_FOLDER because it now includes /settings
    - add projectr/trigger "#setup/@#default_shell_start"
    - add @ projectr/refresh_settings that system links everything into the right place:
        - detect and delete broken system links
    - ignores:
        - provide a better way to add a bunch of ignores (multiline, maybe use git/ignore_multiple)
        - auto-add projectr ignores (.do_not_sync, .ignore, .private)
    - "#home":
        - add a means for plugins to copy existing home folder stuff (creates "#home/thing.private")
        - add a means for plugins to link their files (synced or unsynced) "#add#home/thing.private" or "#add#home/thing.public"
    - "#refresh"
        - commands
        - gitignore
        - home
        - settings
        - env vars
    - finish converting the automatic setup steps:
        - only use PROJECTR_FOLDER (in shell_preferences)
        - update the shell for loops, no globbing (refresh_commands)
        - search for FIXME
    - clean up or remove the "commmands" function
    - change the git config refresh
        - copy in home folder using "#home" interface
        - link to local config
        - somehow do a project config (merge with local config?)
    - update the default hash
    - 
    - make @#start_default_shell code run with a standard nix bash and friends (grep, sed, git, etc)
    - commands/run
    - create a minimal projectr branch
    - commands/help
    - make an easy way to generate relative system links
    - add an automatic renumbering system to @ projectr/refresh_settings
    - documentation: what makes the functions different from commands
    - nix.yaml and @ projectr/refresh_nix
    - use GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES to limit data duplication
    - add a secrets plugin that accepts a password, and then encrypts/decrypts a folder with it
    - add some kind of official settings registry
    
- python:
    - git ignore
    - move install stuff to refresh
    - add the python fixes from reinforcement_playground:
        - tempdir
        - SSL fix
    - update to python38
    - eventually switch to poetry, generate requirements.txt from poetry lock
    - make the checks and hooks use the ./settings/setup_manually/auto_detect.sh or walk-up-tree method
